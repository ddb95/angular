  Whenever I read about working with DOM in Angular I always see one or few of these classes mentioned: ElementRef, TemplateRef, ViewContainerRef and others.
  It's simply a class that wraps native DOM elements in the browser and allows you to work with the DOM by providing the nativeElement object which exposes all the methods and properties of the native elements.

<div #myDiv>

</div>
